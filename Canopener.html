                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In this project, my team and I dissected a commercial can opener 
                    to study its mechanical components, focusing specifically on the 
                    gear mechanisms. The goal was to understand how the gear train 
                    translated user input into blade motion and to replicate its functionality 
                    using SolidWorks. This exercise allowed us to explore real-world applications 
                    of gear systems, study shaft attachments, and analyze constraints such as size, 
                    torque, and safety.</p>
                
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The dissection began with precise caliper measurements of the can opener, 
                    recording key features such as gear tooth counts, diameters, face widths, 
                    heights, and center-to-center distances. We also documented shaft attachment 
                    methods, supporting structures, and any other elements critical to the gear train’s function.</p>

                <p>Using these measurements, the team created an initial CAD model of the gear train 
                    in SolidWorks. This model accurately replicated the original gear ratios and positions 
                    and included supporting shafts and attachment methods to ensure correct alignment and 
                    motion. Bearings, casings, and non-essential components were simplified to streamline 
                    the design process while maintaining functional fidelity.</p>
                <p>Following the initial model, we developed a modified CAD design aimed at improving performance.
                     Based on a hypothetical requirement to increase torque output by 25–50%, we redesigned gear 
                     dimensions and arrangements while keeping the overall footprint similar. Gear mates were added 
                     to ensure functional synchronization in the assembly. </p>
