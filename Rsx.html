                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX) is a design team dedicated to 
                    building a rover for extraterrestrial exploration. With sub-teams 
                    specializing in the arm, science, electrical, software, and mechanical 
                    systems, I contributed as a member of the Arm Mechanical Sub-Team, 
                    focusing on gearbox integration and weight reduction strategies.</p>
               
                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <h3>Fusion 360 Design</h3>
                <p>As part of the arm iterations, new gearboxes were integrated into the system. 
                    I was responsible for designing the gearbox mount, which required precise 
                    measurement and evaluation of dimensions, screw hole placements, and thickness 
                    to ensure both durability and accurate fitting. Multiple iterations were developed, 
                    as the initial design proved oversized, and adjustments were made to refine the fit. 
                    To strengthen the component, I modified wall thicknesses and applied fillets to critical 
                    edges, improving both structural integrity and printability.</p>

                <p>This task advanced my Fusion 360 skills, emphasizing the importance of accuracy, 
                    precision, and consideration of 3D printing tolerances in mechanical design.</p>

                <h3>Carbon Fiber Layup</h3>
                <p>The team is determining ways to reduce the arm's weight. To achieve this,
                     carbon fiber was used, with optimized layup techniques, to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhance strength</li>
                    <li>Reduce cost</li>
                    <li>Decrease weight</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This was done as opposed to opting for a stronger, more expensive material. 
                   Several methods were explored, beginning with wrapping strips around 3D-printed 
                   parts and sealing them using vacuum bagging. The process later progressed to 
                   cutting fibers, placing them into molds, and sealing them under pressure. While 
                   pressure sealing was limited to flat geometries, it produced stronger, more compact, 
                   and cleaner finishes compared to earlier approaches. This experience deepened my 
                   understanding of composite manufacturing and demonstrated how cost-effective methods 
                   can achieve weight reduction without sacrificing performance.</p>
