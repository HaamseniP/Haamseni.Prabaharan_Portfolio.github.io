                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This project focused on addressing accessibility challenges within Hart 
                    House Theatre, including inadequate accessible seating, a non-compliant 
                    slope, and lack of stage access for individuals with mobility limitations. 
                    The scope was confined to the theatre’s physical envelope, with the primary 
                    goal of creating an inclusive environment that met the Toronto Accessibility 
                    Design Guidelines (TADG) while remaining unobtrusive during performances.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The project began with defining the functions, objectives, and constraints. 
                    The primary function was to facilitate inclusive access to seating, walkways, 
                    and the stage. Objectives included ensuring safety, efficiency, and ease of 
                    navigation, while constraints required year-round functionality, compliance with 
                    TADG codes, and maintaining the theatre’s aesthetics during performances. 
                    Stakeholders included patrons, theatre staff, performers, financial donors, 
                    and the City of Toronto.</p>
                <p>As a team, we generated 30 feasible solutions, which were refined through a 
                    structured design process that included feasibility checks, multivoting, a 
                    graphical decision chart, and the Pugh Method. A flowchart of this process is displayed below:</p>

                <p>From this, three final alternatives were shortlisted:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primary Solution: Install a 1.5 m horizontal stair flight with a 1:1 slope near the eastern entrance, integrated with a stair lift and a wheelchair lift (250 kg capacity) for stage access. This design prioritized safety, efficiency, and unobtrusiveness.</li>
                    <li>Alternative 1: Construct a balcony with elevator access to provide wheelchair seating and increase capacity, though resource-intensive.</li>
                    <li>Alternative 2: Introduce staff-assistance with a portable ramp to provide stage access, minimizing cost and resource use.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="Images/hht3.png" alt="design2" height="224" width="501">
                <p>The primary solution was selected as optimal, as it best aligned with the project 
                    objectives while balancing feasibility and intrusiveness. To validate the design, 
                    two testing pathways were planned: (1) physical feasibility testing, using on-site 
                    measurements followed by city approval, and (2) simulation testing, creating a 3D model
                    to assess effectiveness against objectives, later audited by a professional for compliance.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Supported idea generation and consolidation during iterative design sessions.</li>
                    <li>Applied structured decision-making tools (feasibility checks, Pugh Method) to evaluate solutions.</li>
                    <li>Contributed to project documentation, ensuring clarity in technical communication to stakeholders.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strengthened ability to integrate functions, objectives, and constraints into accessible design solutions.</li>
                    <li>Gained experience applying engineering design tools (multivoting, decision charts, Pugh Method) in real-world contexts.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced collaboration and technical communication skills through team coordination and reporting.</li>
