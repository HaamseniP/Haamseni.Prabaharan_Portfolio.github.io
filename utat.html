                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The University of Toronto Aerospace Team is a design team that aims to 
                    conduct crop residue mapping across Canada using satellite-based remote sensing.
                     Within the mechanical team, I contributed to the design and analysis of the 
                     satellite’s structural framework, ensuring compactness, durability, 
                     and stability under launch conditions.</p>
               
                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <h3>FEA Simulations in ANSYS</h3>
                <p>My role was to conduct structural simulations of the ADCS 10M subassembly (a subassembly within the satellie) 
                    to evaluate whether it could withstand launch stresses, vibrations, and accelerations, to help reduce mass. 
                    Using ANSYS Workbench, I performed quasi-static, modal, random vibration, and shock response spectrum analyses 
                    to capture the effects of different loading scenarios during launch.</p>
                <p>First, I simplified key components—including threaded rods, locknuts, EPS boards, and the ADCS model—while ensuring 
                    that material properties were correctly assigned and validated. These included 6061-T6 aluminum, stainless steel, 
                    and FR-4 PCB materials. This step was crucial to maintain accuracy while ensuring that the simulations converged 
                    properly without excessive processing time.</p>

                <p>The analysis process involved multiple iterations of mesh refinement to balance precision with simulation performance.
                    Early iterations revealed stress concentrations on the locknuts and EPS board, prompting design simplifications and 
                    finer meshing around critical areas. By the final iteration, a global element size of 5 mm with localized refinements 
                    to 1.5 mm was applied, resulting in reduced stress concentrations, improved mesh quality, and more reliable 
                    deformation predictions.</p>

                <p>Through this process, I identified critical stress and deformation regions while confirming that the ADCS 
                    subassembly could maintain structural integrity under most simulated launch conditions. These insights will 
                    guide further design improvements for the satellite’s mechanical framework.</p>
